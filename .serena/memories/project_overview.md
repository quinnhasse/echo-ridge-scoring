# Echo Ridge Scoring Engine - Project Overview

## Purpose
Echo Ridge Scoring is a deterministic AI-readiness assessment system for real-world companies. It evaluates companies using a five-part subscore model (D/O/I/M/B) based on structured company data to provide systematic ranking and assessment for AI implementation potential and strategic investment decisions.

## Current Phase
**Phase 4-10 Implementation** - Transforming the Phase 3 scoring system into a production-ready service with risk assessment, batch processing, REST API, calibration, drift monitoring, observability, and downstream integration.

## Five-Component Scoring Model (D/O/I/M/B)
- **D** - Digital Maturity (25%): Website performance, CRM adoption, e-commerce capabilities
- **O** - Operational Complexity (20%): Employee count, location diversity, service portfolio size  
- **I** - Information Flow (20%): Daily document volume and data processing capacity
- **M** - Market Pressure (20%): Competitive density, industry growth, rivalry intensity
- **B** - Budget Signals (15%): Revenue estimates and financial capacity indicators

## Key Goals
- Enable systematic AI opportunity discovery and validation for SMBs at scale
- Integrate with Opportunity Validation Agent and Report Generation Agent
- Replace premium data-enrichment APIs with in-house explainable pipeline
- Support thousands of prospects with transparent scoring and clear reasoning
- Provide deterministic, reproducible outputs with full explainability
