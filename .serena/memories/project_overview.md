# Echo Ridge Scoring Engine - Project Overview

## Project Purpose
Echo Ridge Scoring is an AI-readiness assessment system for real-world companies. It provides a deterministic scoring framework that evaluates companies using a five-part subscore model (D/O/I/M/B) to assess their potential for AI implementation and strategic investment decisions.

## Core Scoring Model (D/O/I/M/B)
- **D** - Digital Maturity (25%): Website performance, CRM adoption, e-commerce capabilities
- **O** - Operational Complexity (20%): Employee count, location diversity, service portfolio size  
- **I** - Information Flow (20%): Daily document volume and data processing capacity
- **M** - Market Pressure (20%): Competitive density, industry growth, rivalry intensity
- **B** - Budget Signals (15%): Revenue estimates and financial capacity indicators

## Current Phase Status
**Phase 3 Complete** - The scoring system is fully operational with:
- Complete D/O/I/M/B subscore calculations
- Statistical normalization with confidence thresholds
- Weighted final scoring (0-100 scale)
- Natural language explanations and warnings
- Comprehensive error handling and edge case management
- Full type safety with Pydantic validation

**Phase 4 (Upcoming)**: Risk assessment filters, market timing analysis, and implementation feasibility scoring

## Key Features
- Deterministic, explainable scoring system
- Statistical normalization with confidence metrics
- Natural language explanations for scores
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Research-focused for business intelligence and investment analysis
