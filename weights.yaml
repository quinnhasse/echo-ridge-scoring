# Component weights (must sum to 1.0)
weights:
  digital: 0.25      # Digital presence and online capabilities  
  operations: 0.20   # Operational maturity and workforce
  info_flow: 0.20    # Information systems and data integration
  market: 0.20       # Market position and competitive landscape  
  budget: 0.15       # Financial capacity and tech investment

# Weight rationale and evidence
rationale:
  digital: |
    Digital presence is the foundation of AI readiness. Companies with strong
    websites, social media, and online reviews show technological adoption capacity.
    Weight of 0.25 reflects this as the primary indicator.
    
  operations: |
    Operational maturity (employee count, years in business, remote capabilities)
    indicates organizational readiness for AI transformation. Weight of 0.20
    balances importance with other factors.
    
  info_flow: |
    CRM systems, APIs, and data integration capabilities are critical for AI
    implementation. Equal weight (0.20) to operations reflects technical readiness.
    
  market: |
    Market size, industry type, and competitive position affect AI ROI potential.
    Weight of 0.20 ensures market viability is properly considered.
    
  budget: |
    While budget is important, it's often the most variable factor. Lower weight
    (0.15) acknowledges that motivated companies find AI funding when other
    indicators are strong.

# Usage notes
usage:
  description: |
    These weights are used by src/scoring.py FinalScorer class to combine
    Digital, Operations, Information Flow, Market, and Budget subscores
    into the final AI-readiness score (0-100).
    
  integration: |
    Weights are loaded automatically by the scoring system. Manual override
    is possible for experimentation but not recommended for production.
    
  monitoring: |
    Weight stability should be monitored through drift detection. Significant
    changes in input distributions may require weight recalibration.
